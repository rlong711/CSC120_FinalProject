# SPOILER ALERT

If your game includes challenges that must be overcome to win, also list them below.

The story starts when you are told you wake up on a beach. You have 3 lives, and if you run out of lives the game terminates and you have to start again. When the game starts, you are asked if you want to look for treasure or not. If you don't want to look for treasure, you lose a life and the game continues anyway. From there you walk to a beach village where there are 3 NPC characters that you can talk to: Blacksmith, Carpenter, and Psychic. You can see all of them, some of them, or none of them. There are consequences to the decision though. 

If the player choses to go to the Blacksmith, they walk to the Blacksmith. This Blacksmith gives them necessary information and sends them to the mines. At the mines, they have to decide wheter or not to take the iron or not. If they decide to take the iron, iron is added to their inventory and they return to the Blacksmith and the Blacksmith akes them a sword. This sword is added to the player inventory. 

If the player choses to go to the Carpenter, the Carpenter asks them if they want a raft or not. If the player says yes, a raft is added to their inventory. If they chose not to take the raft, they continue the game without a raft. 

If the player choses to go to the psychic, the psychic tells you where the treasure is located. 

Once the player has talked to all of the NPC characters they want, they walk out of the village along a path to the treasure. Along this path, a bear attacks them. If they do not have the sword, they lose a life since the bear kills them. As they continue on the path, they see the lake. The player has to decide if they want to go look for the treasure in the lake or continue on the path. If they chose to continue, they are abducted by aliens and lose a life. If they go to the lake, they are safe for the time being. 

Once at the lake, the player must go look for the treasure. If they have a raft, they are able to get to the treasure no probblem. If they don't have a raft, the pirates chasing them (that the player does not know about until this moment) get to them first and the player loses a life. 

Assuming that the player has not used all of their lives, they can retrieve the treasure!
