    When tackling this project, we first decided that we wanted to create the story. We decided that it would be easier to know where to begin, what methods to use, what variables were needed, etc. if we had an outline for how the story/game should run. After we had the story down, we decided to create the classes that would be used and decided how to connect them together. Once that was figured out, we ban to work on creating the methods and establishing the variables. Generally, we tried to work in separate classes so there were no merge conflicts in github. After we had the base of the code, we went back to connect everything together. 

    There was a lot of trial and error for this project. We learned that the same scanner can be used for different inputs, but that often leads to a lot of errors. We learned more about how classses should interact to be make the code the most efficent. We also learned that we should start small in our ideas before we begin coding and designing anything concrete. 

    We had hoped that there would be more locations and challenges, but eventually decided to scale down. For instance, we wanted to have the player be able to take 3 distinct paths to the treasure rather than just the one and we wanted to add a troll/witch character as well. If we had unlimited time, we would make those 3 new paths and add more characters/dialogue to the game. 

    The most helpful feedback we got was how to set up a class that compiles and runs all the other classes. We got this advice from a TA during TA hours. 

    If we could go back and give ourselves some advice, we would tell us to think smaller in the beginning. Our original idea was way more than we could accomplish right out of the gate which was very discouraging. To avoid this and subsequent issues, we should have made the methods first (or had ideas/plans for the methods) before trying to create and connect multiple classes. 

    Generally speaking we worked well as a team. We would meet up a week before things were due to discuss how to divide work and check in. We were constantly communicating about where we were both at in this process. Github, however, made it difficult to work on the project at the same time because we would run into merge errrors. This meant that the bulk of our work happened separetly or with only of us typing while the other assisted.
