Story: 
*Wake up on beach dazed and confused (clue that treasure in the water) 
*Go to village: chose who to talk to (blacksmith, carpenter, psychic) 
*Blacksmith: get a sword you need, and then go on your way 
*Carpenter: get a raft (it’s magical) 
*Psychic: tells u straight up where to go
**Path 1: blacksmith 
    *Go on the path, answer a riddle/troll something to get iron needed to make sword 
    *Come back an can chose to talk to someone else, tells you to go down path one to make sword 
**Path 2: carpenter: 
    *Gives you the raft and tells you the fastest way to go is path 2. 
** Path 3: Psychic: 
    *Tells you path three is the fastest but will encounter this really weird beach bear 
    *If decide to go the path 2 route….
    *Get to fork one: if go left to top of mountain 2 passing lake 1, encounter a giant ant eater and it tries to sniff you up its snout, it wins, so you lose a life and have to start over (need to have to sword to not die) (runtime exception), if get to top of mountain 1 then see treasure in distance and immediately know where she is, if diverted by lake 1 (siren) and lose a life because siren has killed you and have to start over
    *If go forward nothin happens just go to fork 2
    *At fork 2: see sphinx, give you a riddle, if wrong it eats you and you lose a life, if right she tells you to continue into the village and gives you some money 
    *If went to the right at fork 2: at fork 3 no matter what encounter the beach bear (need to have sword, if no sword you die and lose a life) 
    *If defeat the bear at fork 3, you get to top of mountain, you ride the stream down (boogie boarding) and take treasure out of lake 2 (don’t need anything because you just dove right in) 
    *If went to village: have to charm old man to give you the boat (have like A, B, C) responses. If you don’t, he sends you to gentlemen’s club and you get so distracted that you stay there till you die and spend all your money. If charm him, you have to pay him the money for the boat and then you just go get the treasure
**If decide to go path 3 (psychic) 
    *You’re just walking 
    *Have to fight bear at fork 3 
    *Then same as above, go up mountain, go down stream, dive in, get treasure 
**What is the treasure…
    *Jewels: emeralds, sapphires, diamonds, pearls, rubies
    *Beach chair 
    *
